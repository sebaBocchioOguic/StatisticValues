# StatisticValues

The goal of this project is to build a simple and open-source software that returns all statistics values given a dinamic set of numbers.

Statistics values are used to summarize data sets and understand their characteristics. Here are some of the most common ones:

Maximum: The maximum value in the data set.
Minimum: The minimum value in the data set.
Mean / Average: it's calculated by adding all the values in the data set and dividing by the number of values.
Median: The middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there's an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.
Mode: The value that appears most often in the data set. A data set can have multiple modes or none at all.
Range: The difference between the highest and lowest values in the data set.
Variance: The average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. A higher variance indicates a wider spread of data points.
Standard deviation: The square root of the variance. It's measured in the same units as the original data and is easier to interpret than variance.
Percentiles: These divide the data into 100 equal parts. For example, the 25th percentile is the value below which 25% of the data falls.
Quartiles: There are three quartiles, dividing the data into four equal parts. The first quartile (Q1) is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile (Q3) is the same as the 75th percentile. The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between Q3 and Q1 and represents the middle 50% of the data.
